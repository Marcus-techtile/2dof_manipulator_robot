# 2-DOF Manipulator Simulation

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 2-DOF robotic manipulator. The simulation is implemented using MATLAB and includes both a direct simulation and an ODE45-based simulation.

## Files

<!-- - `example_2dof_manipulator.m`: Demonstrates the adaptive RBFNN control for a 2-DOF manipulator using a direct simulation approach.
- `example_2dof_manipulator_ode45.m`: Demonstrates the adaptive RBFNN control for a 2-DOF manipulator using the ODE45 solver. -->
- `manipulator_model.m`: Contains the robot model functions, including the dynamics and disturbance calculations, separated from the main simulation files for modularity and reusability.

## Usage

<!-- 1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Run the desired script (`example_2dof_manipulator.m` or `example_2dof_manipulator_ode45.m`) to start the simulation.
3. The simulation will display plots of the tracking performance, control signals, and other relevant metrics. -->

## Features

<!-- - Adaptive RBFNN control for handling model uncertainties.
- Modular design with separated robot model functions for better code organization.
- Visualization of tracking performance, control efforts, and uncertainty approximations. -->

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later.
